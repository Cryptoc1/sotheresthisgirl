Dunno. To be honest, josh mentioned something about it and I had nothing better to do until ~3:00am, sooooo... yeah. ðŸ˜Ž

### what does what?
sothersthisgirl.py searchs for, and favs tweets, as well as attempts to post updates. The reason tweet.py exsists however, is that sotheresthisgirl.py get rate-limited very easily.
